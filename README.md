# AssemblyInstructions-Assembly

The first project implemented in the Computer Science course of my first semester at FMI. The evaluation of different assembly instructions implemented with AT&T syntax, on x86 architecture.

There are four different problems:
- given a hexazecimal code as an input, return the assembly instruction to be executed;
- given an assembly instruction as an input, return the value of that instruction (no varriables used);
- given an assembly instruction as an input, return the value of that instruction (varriables used);
- given the values for two matrices and an assembly instruction, apply that instrucion on the matrices.
